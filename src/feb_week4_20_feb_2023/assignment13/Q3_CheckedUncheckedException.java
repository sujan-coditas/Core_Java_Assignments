*  exceptions can be divided into two main categories: checked and unchecked exceptions.

Checked exceptions are exceptions that are checked by the compiler at compile-time.
They are exceptions that are thrown by the Java API and must be handled or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.
 Some examples of checked exceptions are
 * IOException,
 *  SQLException,
 * ClassNotFoundException.

Unchecked exceptions, on the other hand, are exceptions that are not checked by the compiler at compile-time.
They are usually caused by programming errors, such as null pointers,
array out of bounds, or arithmetic operations on non-numeric types.
Unchecked exceptions are subclasses of the RuntimeException class or its subclasses,
* such as
* NullPointerException,
* ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
* ArithmeticException.
