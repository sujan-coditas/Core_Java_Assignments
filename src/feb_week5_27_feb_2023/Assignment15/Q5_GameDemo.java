To check the control flow of execution in a multithreaded game,
 you can use various tools and techniques, such as debuggers, profilers, logging, and performance monitoring.
 These tools can help you identify and diagnose issues such as race conditions,
deadlocks, bottlenecks, and memory leaks, and optimize the performance and stability of the game.
In addition to the main thread,
there may be other threads running in the background to perform specific tasks,
such as loading assets from disk, processing network messages, or running AI algorithms.
These threads may communicate with each other and with the main thread
using synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and message queues.
